    <h2>Aversive++ is an Open Source C++ library aimed to ease the development of applications on AVR-based and ARM-based microcontrollers.</h2>

<section id="why">

  <h1>Why using Aversive++</h1>
  
  <p>
    This project provides an interface simple enough to create complex applications,
    and optimized enough to enable small microcontrollers to execute these applications.
  </p>

      <img src="/img/home_icons/cs.svg" />
      <h2>Control systems</h2>
      <p>Control easily motors, and robotic systems with pre-implemented controllers (PID, bang-bang, ...).</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <img src="/img/home_icons/comm.svg" />
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>The library provides a standard C++ API to <b>communicate with others systems.</b></p>
    </li>

      <h2>Memory security</h2>
      <p>With Aversive++, you can use most common containers, specially designed for embedded systems.</p>
    </li>

      <h2>The C++ philosophy</h2>
      <p><i>"Unused features should not negatively impact created executables"</i></p>
    </li>

    <li class="box">
      <img src="/img/home_icons/embed.svg" />
      <h2>Multiplatform</h2>
      <p>Thanks to Aversive++ library, the same application can be <b>compiled for AVRs, ARMs, and the simulator named SASIAE.</b></p>
    </li>

    <li class="box">
      <img src="/img/home_icons/warn.svg" />
      <h2>Compile-time verification</h2>
      <p>The library <b>warns you</b> if you use badly your hardware equipment.</p>
    </li>
    </div>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    A documentation is also provided as well as support through our github repository,
    the project is quite young, but we are working on it on a daily basis.

    Three layers of control systems, a trajectory manager, a path finding algorithm,
    a multi-agent-like strategy system, and everything working with a 4KBytes-sized RAM !
    This video has been recorded in 2014.
