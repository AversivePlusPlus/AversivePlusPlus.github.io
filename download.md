# Development version

The current version is very different from v14.11 (see below), the last stable version.
There is no download links, but you can check the [wiki](https://github.com/AversivePlusPlus/AversivePlusPlus/wiki) 
to see installation tutorials.

# Old stable version (2014)

These [stables versions](https://github.com/astralien3000/aversive--) were released in 2014. 
They support ATMega2560 and ATMega128 microcontollers, with only a few specific devices supported.
You can also use it with the [SASIAE simulator](https://github.com/astralien3000/tinySASIAE), 
that was developed by the same team as the library.

## v14.11 (release candidate)

This version is intended to be used with the simulator, and every known bugs have been fixed (if you find one, please, contact us ;) ! )
It is used for teaching basics of 2 wheeled robot control.
